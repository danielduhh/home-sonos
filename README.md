# Google Home x Sonos webhook

A node.js, API.API, http webhook that integrates Google Home with Sonos, running on your local wifi. 
This integration uses the Agent backup inside the /agent direcotry

## ** Under development **

## Usage

To invoke this custom API.API [Agent](https://docs.api.ai/docs/concept-agents), tell your Google Home to "talk to my Sonos player". 
This initiates your conversation with Google Home & listens for [Actions](https://docs.api.ai/docs/concept-actions) invoked by specified
[Intents](https://docs.api.ai/docs/concept-intents). Once invoked, the intents trigger this webhook, which then processes the request
and calls the appropriate node-sonos-http-api endpoint. Voil√†
